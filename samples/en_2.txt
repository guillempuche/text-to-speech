Hey, come on in! It's so good to see you again. How long has it been — a year? More? You look great. Sit down, I'll make us some coffee. I was just telling someone about that trip we took to the mountains — remember when we got completely lost and ended up at that tiny restaurant? That was one of the best nights ever.
