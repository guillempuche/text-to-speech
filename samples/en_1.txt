Hi, I'm recording a clean voice sample for text-to-speech cloning. Today I'm speaking at a steady pace, with clear pronunciation and natural pauses. I live in Barcelona, and I work on software products. In the morning I usually drink coffee, check my calendar, and plan the most important tasks for the day. If you can hear any background noise, I'll stop and record again.
