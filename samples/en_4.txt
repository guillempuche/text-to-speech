Last weekend, I took a walk near the sea just before sunset. The air was cool, and the streets were quieter than usual. I stopped for a few minutes to listen to the waves and watch the light change. It wasn't a big adventure, but it felt calm and memorable. Sometimes the simplest moments are the easiest to keep.
