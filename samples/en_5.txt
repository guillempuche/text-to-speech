So here's the thing — I'm not sure I agree with that approach. I mean, it sounds reasonable on paper, but in practice? It's going to create more problems than it solves. Why don't we try it the other way around? Start small, validate the idea first, and then scale up if it works. That way we don't waste a month building something nobody actually needs.
